Normally Entertainment industry usually hires sketchers or artist to create new characters. But it is very time consuming as it takes more that 2 weeks to create new characters. And these companies need to spend high amount of money to the artist. 

So to avoid this we use anime GAN . We are going to give some random animated image as input and according to that we will get the new generated anime characters as output. It is very accurate.
